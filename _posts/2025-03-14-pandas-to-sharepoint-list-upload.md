# **Uploading a Pandas DataFrame to a SharePoint List with Column Mapping in Python**

## **Introduction**
When working with SharePoint lists, one common challenge is handling **column name mappings** between **SharePointâ€™s internal field names** and the **display names used in the UI**. If you are working with Python and Pandas, automating this process can be very useful, especially when **uploading multiple rows of data** efficiently.

In this post, we will walk through how to:
1. Retrieve column mappings from SharePoint (internal names vs. display names).
2. Transform a Pandas DataFrame so that its column names match SharePoint's required format.
3. Upload multiple rows to SharePoint in an **optimized batch process** while avoiding system columns.

---

## **Prerequisites**
To follow this guide, you need:
- **Office365-REST-Python-Client** installed:  
  ```python
  pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client
  ```
- **Access to a SharePoint list** where you have permissions to read and write.
- **A registered app in SharePoint** to obtain `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication.

---

## **Step 1: Establish a SharePoint Connection**
Before reading or writing data, we need to authenticate and establish a connection to SharePoint.

```python
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential

# Define credentials and site URL
site_url = "https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"

# Create authentication context
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(ClientCredential(client_id, client_secret))
```

---

## **Step 2: Retrieve Column Mappings (Including System Columns)**
SharePoint uses **internal field names** that differ from the **display names** users see in the UI. Additionally, some fields (like `ID`, `Created`, `Modified`) are **read-only system fields** that must be excluded before uploading data.

```python
def get_column_mappings(ctx, list_name):
    """
    Retrieves column mappings from SharePoint (internal name â†’ display name)
    and identifies system columns.
    """
    try:
        sharepoint_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)
        fields = sharepoint_list.fields.get().execute_query()

        column_mappings = {}
        system_columns = []

        for field in fields:
            field_title = field.properties.get('Title')
            field_internal = field.properties.get('StaticName')
            field_read_only = field.properties.get('ReadOnlyField', False)

            column_mappings[field_title] = field_internal

            if field_read_only or field_internal in ["ID", "Created", "Modified", "Author", "Editor"]:
                system_columns.append(field_internal)  # Store system fields

        return column_mappings, system_columns

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving column mappings: {e}")
        return {}, []
```

---

## **Step 3: Transform DataFrame to Match SharePoint Fields**
Once we have the mappings, we need to **rename the columns in our Pandas DataFrame** so that SharePoint can recognize them.

```python
def transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings):
    """
    Transforms DataFrame column names to match SharePoint's internal names.
    """
    try:
        inverse_mapping = {v: k for k, v in column_mappings.items()}  # Reverse mapping
        df_transformed = df.rename(columns=inverse_mapping)
        return df_transformed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error transforming DataFrame: {e}")
        return df
```

---

## **Step 4: Upload Multiple Rows to SharePoint (Ignoring System Columns)**
Now that our DataFrame is correctly formatted, we need to upload all rows efficiently while **excluding system columns**.

```python
def upload_to_sharepoint(ctx, list_name, df):
    """
    Uploads multiple DataFrame rows to a SharePoint List in batches,
    while ignoring system columns.
    """
    try:
        column_mappings, system_columns = get_column_mappings(ctx, list_name)
        df_transformed = transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings)

        # Remove system columns before upload
        df_transformed = df_transformed.drop(columns=[col for col in system_columns if col in df_transformed.columns], errors='ignore')

        sharepoint_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)

        batch = ctx.new_batch()  # Create a batch process

        for _, row in df_transformed.iterrows():
            item = sharepoint_list.add_item(row.to_dict())
            ctx.execute_query(batch)  # Add operation to batch

        batch.execute_query()  # Execute all batch operations
        print("All data successfully uploaded to SharePoint!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error uploading data to SharePoint: {e}")
```

---

## **Step 5: Putting It All Together**
### **Example Usage**
```python
# Define SharePoint List Name
list_name = "YourSharePointListName"

# Sample Pandas DataFrame (with display names)
import pandas as pd
data = {
    'Display Column 1': ['Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3'],
    'Display Column 2': ['ValueA', 'ValueB', 'ValueC'],
    'Created': ['2024-01-01', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-03'],  # System column
    'ID': [1, 2, 3]  # System column
}  
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Upload data to SharePoint (system columns will be removed)
upload_to_sharepoint(ctx, list_name, df)
```

---

## **Conclusion**
This guide provides a **structured approach** to uploading a Pandas DataFrame to a SharePoint List while:
âœ” **Retrieving column mappings**  
âœ” **Transforming column names**  
âœ” **Ignoring system columns**  
âœ” **Uploading multiple rows in an optimized batch process**  

This modular approach ensures **scalability** and **efficiency** when dealing with large datasets in SharePoint.

## **Next Steps**
ðŸš€ You can now:
- Extend this approach to **update existing records** instead of just adding new ones.
- Implement error handling for specific field types (e.g., **dates, multi-choice fields, lookup fields**).
- Automate the process using **scheduled jobs** if needed.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you need further refinements. ðŸš€
