# **Uploading a Pandas DataFrame to a SharePoint List with Column Mapping in Python**

## **Introduction**
When working with SharePoint lists, one common challenge is handling **column name mappings** between **SharePointâ€™s internal field names** and the **display names used in the UI**. If you are working with Python and Pandas, automating this process can be very useful, especially when **uploading multiple rows of data** efficiently.

In this post, we will walk through how to:
1. Retrieve column mappings from SharePoint (internal names vs. display names).
2. Transform a Pandas DataFrame so that its column names match SharePoint's required format.
3. Upload multiple rows to SharePoint in an **optimized batch process** while avoiding system columns.
4. Dynamically detect the correct internal name for the **Title** column to ensure it is retained correctly.

## **Prerequisites**
To follow this guide, you need:
- **Office365-REST-Python-Client** installed:  
  ```python
  pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client
  ```
- **Access to a SharePoint list** where you have permissions to read and write.
- **A registered app in SharePoint** to obtain `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication.

---

## **Step 1: Establish a SharePoint Connection**
Before reading or writing data, we need to authenticate and establish a connection to SharePoint.

```python
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential

# Define credentials and site URL
site_url = "https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"

# Create authentication context
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(ClientCredential(client_id, client_secret))
```

---

## **Step 2: Retrieve Column Mappings (Including System Columns & Title Handling)**
SharePoint uses **internal field names** that differ from the **display names** users see in the UI. Additionally, some fields (like `ID`, `Created`, `Modified`) are **read-only system fields** that must be excluded before uploading data. However, the **Title** column should not be removed, and its correct internal name must be dynamically detected.

```python
def get_column_mappings(ctx, list_name):
    """
    Retrieves column mappings from SharePoint (internal name â†’ display name)
    and identifies system columns (excluding the actual internal name of 'Title').
    """
    try:
        sharepoint_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)
        fields = sharepoint_list.fields.get().execute_query()

        column_mappings = {}
        system_columns = []
        title_internal_name = None  # Store the actual internal name of 'Title'

        for field in fields:
            field_title = field.properties.get('Title')  # Display Name
            field_internal = field.properties.get('StaticName')  # Internal Name
            field_read_only = field.properties.get('ReadOnlyField', False)

            column_mappings[field_internal] = field_title

            # Identify the actual internal name for 'Title' dynamically
            if field_title.lower() == "title":
                title_internal_name = field_internal

            # Exclude system columns but keep the actual 'Title' field
            if field_read_only and field_internal != title_internal_name:
                system_columns.append(field_internal)

        return column_mappings, system_columns, title_internal_name

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving column mappings: {e}")
        return {}, [], None
```

---

## **Step 3: Transform DataFrame to Match SharePoint Fields**
Once we have the mappings, we need to **rename the columns in our Pandas DataFrame** so that SharePoint can recognize them.

```python
def transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings):
    """
    Transforms DataFrame column names to match SharePoint's internal names.
    """
    try:
        df_transformed = df.rename(columns=column_mappings)
        return df_transformed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error transforming DataFrame: {e}")
        return df
```

---

## **Step 4: Upload Multiple Rows to SharePoint (Ignoring System Columns but Keeping Title)**
Now that our DataFrame is correctly formatted, we need to upload all rows efficiently while **excluding system columns** but ensuring the correct internal name for "Title" remains.

```python
def upload_to_sharepoint(ctx, list_name, df):
    """
    Uploads multiple DataFrame rows to a SharePoint List in batches,
    while ignoring system columns (but keeping the correct internal name of 'Title').
    """
    try:
        column_mappings, system_columns, title_internal_name = get_column_mappings(ctx, list_name)
        df_transformed = transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings)

        # Remove system columns but ensure 'Title' is NOT removed
        system_columns = [col for col in system_columns if col != title_internal_name]
        df_transformed = df_transformed.drop(columns=[col for col in system_columns if col in df_transformed.columns], errors='ignore')

        sharepoint_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)

        batch = ctx.new_batch()  # Create a batch process

        for _, row in df_transformed.iterrows():
            item = sharepoint_list.add_item(row.to_dict())
            ctx.execute_query(batch)  # Add operation to batch

        batch.execute_query()  # Execute all batch operations
        print("All data successfully uploaded to SharePoint!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error uploading data to SharePoint: {e}")
```

---

## **Final Check Before Uploading**
Before uploading, verify the transformed DataFrame and the internal name of "Title":
```python
df_transformed = transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings)
print("Final Columns Before Upload:", df_transformed.columns.tolist())
print("Internal Name for 'Title':", title_internal_name)
```

---

## **Conclusion**
This guide provides a **structured approach** to uploading a Pandas DataFrame to a SharePoint List while:
âœ” **Retrieving column mappings**  
âœ” **Transforming column names**  
âœ” **Ignoring system columns (except 'Title')**  
âœ” **Dynamically detecting the correct internal name for 'Title'**  
âœ” **Uploading multiple rows in an optimized batch process**  

This modular approach ensures **scalability** and **efficiency** when dealing with large datasets in SharePoint.

## **Next Steps**
ðŸš€ You can now:
- Extend this approach to **update existing records** instead of just adding new ones.
- Implement error handling for specific field types (e.g., **dates, multi-choice fields, lookup fields**).
- Automate the process using **scheduled jobs** if needed.
