### **Introduction**
When working with SharePoint lists, one common challenge is handling **column name mappings** between **SharePointâ€™s internal field names** and the **display names used in the UI**. If you are working with Python and Pandas, automating this process can be very useful, especially when **uploading multiple rows of data** efficiently.

In this post, we will walk through how to:
1. Retrieve column mappings from SharePoint (internal names vs. display names).
2. Transform a Pandas DataFrame so that its column names match SharePoint's required format.
3. Upload multiple rows to SharePoint in an **optimized batch process**.

---

## **Prerequisites**
To follow this guide, you need:
- **Office365-REST-Python-Client** installed:  
  ```bash
  pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client
  ```
- **Access to a SharePoint list** where you have permissions to read and write.
- **A registered app in SharePoint** to obtain `client_id` and `client_secret` for authentication.

---

## **Step 1: Establish a SharePoint Connection**
Before reading or writing data, we need to authenticate and establish a connection to SharePoint.

```python
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential

# Define credentials and site URL
site_url = "https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"

# Create authentication context
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(ClientCredential(client_id, client_secret))
```

---

## **Step 2: Retrieve Column Mappings**
SharePoint uses **internal field names** that differ from the **display names** users see in the UI. To ensure data is uploaded correctly, we must retrieve and store these mappings.

```python
def get_column_mappings(ctx, list_name):
    """
    Retrieves column mappings from SharePoint (internal name â†’ display name).
    """
    try:
        sharepoint_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)
        fields = sharepoint_list.fields.get().execute_query()
        column_mappings = {
            field.properties.get('Title'): field.properties.get('StaticName') 
            for field in fields
        }
        return column_mappings
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving column mappings: {e}")
        return {}
```

### **How It Works**
- We query SharePoint to **get all fields** from the list.
- We create a **dictionary** that maps **display names** to **internal field names**.
- This mapping will be used when transforming DataFrame columns before upload.

---

## **Step 3: Transform DataFrame to Match SharePoint Fields**
Once we have the mappings, we need to **rename the columns in our Pandas DataFrame** so that SharePoint can recognize them.

```python
def transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings):
    """
    Transforms DataFrame column names to match SharePoint's internal names.
    """
    try:
        inverse_mapping = {v: k for k, v in column_mappings.items()}  # Reverse mapping
        df_transformed = df.rename(columns=inverse_mapping)
        return df_transformed
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error transforming DataFrame: {e}")
        return df
```

### **Why This is Important**
- **Ensures correct column names** before uploading to SharePoint.
- **Prevents errors** when inserting data into SharePoint.

---

## **Step 4: Upload Multiple Rows to SharePoint**
Now that our DataFrame is correctly formatted, we need to upload all rows efficiently.

```python
def upload_to_sharepoint(ctx, list_name, df):
    """
    Uploads multiple DataFrame rows to a SharePoint List in batches.
    """
    try:
        column_mappings = get_column_mappings(ctx, list_name)
        df_transformed = transform_dataframe(df, column_mappings)

        sharepoint_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)

        batch = ctx.new_batch()  # Create a batch process

        for _, row in df_transformed.iterrows():
            item = sharepoint_list.add_item(row.to_dict())
            ctx.execute_query(batch)  # Add operation to batch

        batch.execute_query()  # Execute all batch operations
        print("All data successfully uploaded to SharePoint!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error uploading data to SharePoint: {e}")
```

### **Optimizations**
âœ… **Batch Processing** â€“ Instead of sending one request per row (which is slow), we batch all insert operations and execute them together.  
âœ… **Handles Multiple Rows** â€“ Iterates through all rows in the DataFrame and inserts them in SharePoint.  
âœ… **Preserves Column Mapping** â€“ Ensures correct field names before upload.  

---

## **Step 5: Putting It All Together**
### **Example Usage**
```python
# Define SharePoint List Name
list_name = "YourSharePointListName"

# Sample Pandas DataFrame (with display names)
import pandas as pd
data = {
    'Display Column 1': ['Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3'],
    'Display Column 2': ['ValueA', 'ValueB', 'ValueC']
}  
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Upload data to SharePoint
upload_to_sharepoint(ctx, list_name, df)
```

---

## **Conclusion**
This guide provides a **structured approach** to uploading a Pandas DataFrame to a SharePoint List while:
âœ” **Retrieving column mappings**  
âœ” **Transforming column names**  
âœ” **Uploading multiple rows in an optimized batch process**  

This modular approach ensures **scalability** and **efficiency** when dealing with large datasets in SharePoint.

## **Next Steps**
ðŸš€ You can now:
- Extend this approach to **update existing records** instead of just adding new ones.  
- Implement error handling for specific field types (e.g., **dates, multi-choice fields, lookup fields**).  
- Automate the process using **scheduled jobs** if needed.
