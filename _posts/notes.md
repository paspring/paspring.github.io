### **Stakeholder Update: PowerApps Gallery Development Progress**  

#### **Project Overview**  
The PowerApps Gallery application retrieves and displays data from a SharePoint list, which originates from a Snowflake database. The system provides **filtering, pagination, and editing capabilities** to enhance data management and streamline workflows. This document outlines the current implementation status, key functionalities, pending enhancements, and next steps.  

---

## **1. Current Functionalities Implemented**  

### **1.1 Data Retrieval & Display**  
**Implemented:**  
- Data is retrieved from **[SharePoint List Name]**, sourced from a Snowflake database.  
- Snowflake queries for data retrieval are fully developed and operational.  
- **Current SharePoint List is a Sample Dataset** – The full dataset will be loaded once the missing fields from stakeholder files are populated.  

### **1.2 Displayed Columns**  
The following columns are included in the gallery display:  
- **[Column 1 Name]**  
- **[Column 2 Name]**  
- **[Column 3 Name]**  
- **[Additional Columns as Required]**  

*(Insert screenshot of the displayed gallery here.)*  

### **1.3 Filtering Capabilities**  
**Implemented:**  
- **General Filter:** Allows filtering based on key columns (**[Specify Key Columns]**).  
- **Numeric Search:** Supports searches by item ID.  
- **Site Search:** Enables filtering based on site.  

*(Insert screenshot demonstrating the filtering functionality here, including dropdowns, text inputs, and search buttons.)*  

### **1.4 Pagination**  
**Implemented:**  
- **Pagination mechanism** manages large datasets efficiently.  
- Users navigate pages via **Next Page / Previous Page buttons**.  
- The displayed gallery references a **hidden processing gallery** to optimize performance.  

*(Insert screenshot showing the pagination system and navigation buttons.)*  

### **1.5 Editing Fields**  
**Implemented:**  
- Users can edit the following three fields:  
  - **Field 1:** [Specify Field Name]  
  - **Field 2:** [Specify Field Name]  
  - **Field 3:** [Specify Field Name]  
- Changes are successfully saved back to SharePoint.  

*(Insert screenshot showing the editing functionality, including editable fields and the save button.)*

## **2. Upcoming Enhancement: Auto-Populating Editable Fields**  

### **Current Issue**  
- Fields **Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** are initially blank when loaded into the gallery.  
- Users currently enter data manually, even when information exists in stakeholder files.  

### **Planned Solution**  
- **Data Processing Step:** A data integration process will be implemented to **automatically populate Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** using matched records from **[Stakeholder File Name]** and **[Database File Name]**.  
- **Objective:** Reduce manual input by pre-populating existing values before users interact with the dataset.  

### **Implementation Approach**  
1. **Extract** stakeholder files and database records.  
2. **Perform a matching operation** to populate the editable fields.  
3. **Update Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** before loading the dataset into SharePoint.  
4. **Validate data accuracy** to ensure correctness.  
5. **Deploy the enhancement** and monitor user feedback.

## **3. Data Integration and Process Scheduling**  

### **3.1 Full Table Loading After Auto-Population**  
- The **current SharePoint list contains only a sample of the data** for testing and validation.  
- After successfully populating missing fields, the **entire dataset from Snowflake will be loaded into SharePoint**.  

### **3.2 Scheduling of Data Updates**  
Pending **integration issues between SharePoint and Snowflake** are currently under review. In the meantime, the following scheduling steps need to be defined:  
1. **Manual Update Process:** Establish a structured manual process to refresh the data at regular intervals.  
2. **Snapshot Backup Mechanism:** Implement a backup process to take periodic snapshots of the data before each update to ensure data integrity and rollback capability.

## **4. Design and User Interface Considerations**  

### **4.1 Branding & Visual Identity**  
To ensure consistency with corporate branding, stakeholders should provide guidance on:  
- **Logos:** Specify if a company or department logo should be displayed within the PowerApps interface.  
- **Color Scheme:** Define any preferred colors for buttons, backgrounds, or highlights.  
- **Fonts & Styling:** Identify any required fonts, text sizes, or styles that align with company guidelines.  
- **Titles & Headings:** Confirm any specific wording, headers, or page titles that should be used in the UI.  

*(Insert example UI mockup or wireframe if available.)*  

### **4.2 Layout & User Experience**  
- **Navigation Structure:** Confirm whether the current layout is intuitive or if adjustments are needed.  
- **Button Placement:** Ensure key actions such as "Search," "Save," and "Reset" are easily accessible.  
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Verify if the application needs to be optimized for mobile or tablet users.  
- **User Feedback & Alerts:** Determine if notification messages (e.g., "Changes saved successfully") should be customized.

## **5. Requirement Fulfillment Status**  

| Requirement                                      | Status        | Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Data Retrieval from Snowflake → SharePoint**  | Implemented  | Queries are fully developed and retrieving data correctly. |
| **Filtering by key columns, item ID, and site** | Implemented  | Functional and tested. |
| **Pagination for large datasets**               | Implemented  | Next/Previous navigation is working. |
| **Editable Fields (Field 1, Field 2, Field 3)** | Implemented  | Users can edit and save changes successfully. |
| **Auto-Population of Editable Fields**         | In Progress  | Matching with stakeholder files pending implementation. |
| **Full Data Loading**                           | Pending      | Dependent on completion of missing field population. |
| **Manual Data Update & Backup Process**        | Pending      | Scheduling process to be defined. |
| **Branding & UI Customization**                 | Pending      | Requires stakeholder input for logos, colors, and layout adjustments. |

## **6. Next Steps**  
- **Complete Data Join Process:** Develop and implement logic to populate **Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** before user interaction.  
- **Test and Validate:** Ensure accuracy of the pre-filled values.  
- **Full Table Loading:** Replace the sample SharePoint list with the complete dataset after auto-population.  
- **Define Manual Update & Backup Process:** Establish a structured approach for data refresh and integrity.  
- **UI Review:** Confirm branding, layout, and design specifications with stakeholders.  
- **Stakeholder Review:** Validate that the system meets business requirements before full deployment.  

This document provides an overview of the current progress, completed functionalities, pending enhancements, and open items requiring stakeholder input. Additional details such as **column names, field mappings, and specific business logic** should be included as needed.
