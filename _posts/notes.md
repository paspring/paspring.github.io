### **Stakeholder Update: PowerApps Gallery Development Progress**  

#### **Project Overview**  
The PowerApps Gallery application retrieves and displays data from a SharePoint list, which originates from a Snowflake database. The system provides **filtering, pagination, and editing capabilities** to enhance data management and streamline workflows. This document outlines the current implementation status, key functionalities, and planned enhancements.  

---

## **1. Current Functionalities Implemented**  

### **1.1 Data Retrieval & Display**  
**Implemented:**  
- Data is retrieved from **[SharePoint List Name]**, sourced from a Snowflake database.  
- Snowflake queries for data retrieval are fully developed and operational.  

### **1.2 Displayed Columns**  
The following columns are included in the gallery display:  
- **[Column 1 Name]**  
- **[Column 2 Name]**  
- **[Column 3 Name]**  
- **[Additional Columns as Required]**  

### **1.3 Filtering Capabilities**  
**Implemented:**  
- **General Filter:** Allows filtering based on key columns (**[Specify Key Columns]**).  
- **Numeric Search:** Supports searches by item ID.  
- **Site Search:** Enables filtering based on site.  

### **1.4 Pagination**  
**Implemented:**  
- **Pagination mechanism** manages large datasets efficiently.  
- Users navigate pages via **Next Page / Previous Page buttons**.  
- The displayed gallery references a **hidden processing gallery** to optimize performance.  

### **1.5 Editing Fields**  
**Implemented:**  
- Users can edit the following three fields:  
  - **Field 1:** [Specify Field Name]  
  - **Field 2:** [Specify Field Name]  
  - **Field 3:** [Specify Field Name]  
- Changes are successfully saved back to SharePoint.

## **2. Upcoming Enhancement: Auto-Populating Editable Fields**  

### **Current Issue**  
- Fields **Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** are initially blank when loaded into the gallery.  
- Users currently enter data manually, even when information exists in stakeholder files.  

### **Planned Solution**  
- **Data Processing Step:** A data integration process will be implemented to **automatically populate Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** using matched records from **[Stakeholder File Name]** and **[Database File Name]**.  
- **Objective:** Reduce manual input by pre-populating existing values before users interact with the dataset.  

### **Implementation Approach**  
1. **Extract** stakeholder files and database records.  
2. **Perform a matching operation** to populate the editable fields.  
3. **Update Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** before loading the dataset into SharePoint.  
4. **Validate data accuracy** to ensure correctness.  
5. **Deploy the enhancement** and monitor user feedback.

## **3. Requirement Fulfillment Status**  

| Requirement                                      | Status        | Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Data Retrieval from Snowflake â†’ SharePoint**  | Implemented  | Queries are fully developed and retrieving data correctly. |
| **Filtering by key columns, item ID, and site** | Implemented  | Functional and tested. |
| **Pagination for large datasets**               | Implemented  | Next/Previous navigation is working. |
| **Editable Fields (Field 1, Field 2, Field 3)** | Implemented  | Users can edit and save changes successfully. |
| **Auto-Population of Editable Fields**         | In Progress  | Matching with stakeholder files pending implementation. |

---

## **4. Next Steps**  
- **Complete Data Join Process:** Develop and implement logic to populate **Field 1, Field 2, and Field 3** before user interaction.  
- **Test and Validate:** Ensure accuracy of the pre-filled values.  
- **Stakeholder Review:** Confirm that the system meets business requirements before full deployment.  

This document provides an overview of the current progress, completed functionalities, and pending enhancements. Additional details such as **column names, field mappings, and specific business logic** should be included as needed.
