Title: Streamlining SharePoint List Updates in Python: A Practical Guide


---

Introduction

Updating SharePoint list items programmatically is a common need for developers working with SharePoint. Whether automating workflows, synchronizing data, or integrating with other systems, efficiently managing list updates can save time and effort.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to build a reusable Python script to update one or more items in a SharePoint list. We'll apply software design principles such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to keep the code clean, maintainable, and reusable. Let’s dive in!

Why Automate SharePoint Updates?

Manually updating SharePoint list items through the web interface is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with multiple items. Automating the process using Python not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors.

Using libraries such as the Office365-REST-Python-Client, you can seamlessly connect to your SharePoint environment and interact with lists and items programmatically.

Key Challenges and Best Practices

Before we dive into the code, let’s address the challenges developers commonly face:

1. Efficiency: Avoid redundant network calls when updating multiple items.


2. Error Handling: Ensure errors for one item don’t block updates for others.


3. Reusability: Keep the code modular so it can be reused for different lists or data sets.


4. Scalability: Handle both single and batch updates effectively.



By following the Single Responsibility Principle, we can ensure that each function in our script is focused on one specific task, making the script modular and easier to maintain.

Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

1. Retrieving the SharePoint List

The first step is to retrieve the SharePoint list by its name. If the list doesn’t exist, the function should handle the error gracefully.

def get_sharepoint_list(ctx, list_name):
    """
    Retrieves a SharePoint list by name.
    """
    try:
        return ctx.web.lists.get_by_title(list_name)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve the SharePoint list '{list_name}': {e}")
        return None


---

2. Fetching a List Item by ID

To update a specific list item, you need to fetch it by its unique ID. If the item doesn’t exist, the function returns None.

def get_list_item_by_id(sharepoint_list, item_id):
    """
    Retrieves a SharePoint list item by its ID.
    """
    try:
        return sharepoint_list.get_item_by_id(item_id)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve item with ID {item_id}: {e}")
        return None


---

3. Updating a Single List Item

Next, create a function to update a single list item with new properties. This function should:

Validate that item_id exists.

Skip any invalid fields.

Prepare the item for update and handle any errors during the process.


def update_single_list_item(ctx, sharepoint_list, item_data):
    """
    Updates a single SharePoint list item with the provided properties.
    """
    item_id = item_data.get('item_id')
    if not item_id:
        print("Error: 'item_id' is required in the input to update the SharePoint list item.")
        return False

    list_item = get_list_item_by_id(sharepoint_list, item_id)
    if not list_item:
        return False

    try:
        for key, value in item_data.items():
            if key != 'item_id':  # Skip 'item_id' key
                list_item.set_property(key, value)

        list_item.update()
        print(f"Item with ID {item_id} prepared for update.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to prepare update for item with ID {item_id}: {e}")
        return False


---

4. Updating Multiple List Items

Now, bring it all together in a function to handle batch updates. This function:

Iterates through the list of items to update.

Uses the update_single_list_item function to handle each item.

Executes the batch update in one network call using ctx.execute_query().


def update_multiple_list_items(ctx, list_name, items_to_update):
    """
    Updates multiple SharePoint list items with the provided properties.
    """
    sharepoint_list = get_sharepoint_list(ctx, list_name)
    if not sharepoint_list:
        return

    successful_updates = 0
    for item_data in items_to_update:
        if update_single_list_item(ctx, sharepoint_list, item_data):
            successful_updates += 1

    # Execute all changes at once
    try:
        ctx.execute_query()
        print(f"Successfully updated {successful_updates} item(s).")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to execute updates: {e}")

Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the above functions to update multiple SharePoint list items:

update_details = [
    {'item_id': 8, 'Title': 'First Update', 'x': '100', 'y': '100'},
    {'item_id': 9, 'Title': 'Second Update', 'x': '200', 'y': '200'}
]

update_multiple_list_items(ctx, list_name="YourListName", items_to_update=update_details)

Output

If everything works as expected, the script will print messages for each updated item and a summary at the end:

Item with ID 8 prepared for update.
Item with ID 9 prepared for update.
Successfully updated 2 item(s).


---

Why This Approach Works

1. Single Responsibility Principle:

Each function has a well-defined purpose, making it easier to test and debug.



2. Batch Processing:

Network calls are minimized by batching updates with ctx.execute_query().



3. Error Handling:

Errors for individual items are handled gracefully, allowing the script to continue with other updates.



4. Reusability:

The modular structure makes the code easy to adapt for other SharePoint lists or use cases.

Final Thoughts

By following a structured, modular approach, you can efficiently update SharePoint list items while keeping your code clean and maintainable. Whether you’re working with a single item or handling bulk updates, this method ensures that your script is scalable and resilient.
