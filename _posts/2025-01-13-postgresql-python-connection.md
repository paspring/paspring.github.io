If you're working with PostgreSQL databases in your projects, handling connections efficiently and securely is essential. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of a Python class that **reads credentials from a JSON file** and **returns SQL query results as a pandas DataFrame**.

---

### **üìö Key Components of the `PostgresConnector` Class**

This class handles:
- Secure loading of credentials from a JSON file.
- Connection management with PostgreSQL using `psycopg2`.
- Error logging for better debugging.
- Query execution with `pandas` for data analysis.

---

### **üîß Full Python Code** (with explanations)

```python
import psycopg2  # PostgreSQL adapter for Python
import pandas as pd  # Data analysis library
import json  # For reading configuration files
import logging  # For logging errors

# Configure logging to track errors in a log file
logging.basicConfig(filename='db_connector.log', level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class PostgresConnector:
    def __init__(self, config_file):
        """
        Initialize the PostgreSQL connection using a JSON config file.
        """
        self.config_file = config_file
        self.conn = None  # Connection placeholder
        self.credentials = self._read_credentials()

    def _read_credentials(self):
        """
        Read database credentials from a JSON file.
        """
        try:
            with open(self.config_file, 'r') as file:
                return json.load(file)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error reading the configuration file: {e}")
            print(f"Error reading the configuration file: {e}")
            return None

    def connect(self):
        """
        Establish connection to PostgreSQL database using credentials from the JSON file.
        """
        if not self.credentials:
            print("No valid credentials found. Check your JSON config file.")
            return

        try:
            self.conn = psycopg2.connect(
                host=self.credentials['host'],
                port=self.credentials['port'],
                dbname=self.credentials['dbname'],
                user=self.credentials['user'],
                password=self.credentials['password'],
                options='-c statement_timeout=30000'  # 30-second timeout for queries
            )
            print("‚úÖ Connection successful!")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to connect to database: {e}")
            print(f"‚ùå Failed to connect to database: {e}")

    def query(self, sql_query):
        """
        Execute a SQL query and return results as a pandas DataFrame.
        """
        if self.conn is None:
            print("No connection established. Please call `connect()` first.")
            return None

        try:
            df = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, self.conn)  # Run query and store results as DataFrame
            print("‚úÖ Query executed successfully!")
            return df
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Failed to execute query: {e}")
            print(f"‚ùå Failed to execute query: {e}")
            return None

    def close(self):
        """
        Close the database connection.
        """
        if self.conn:
            self.conn.close()
            print("üîí Connection closed.")

    def __enter__(self):
        """
        Enable use with 'with' statement for automatic resource management.
        """
        self.connect()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        """
        Automatically close the connection when exiting 'with' block.
        """
        self.close()

### **üåü How to Use the `PostgresConnector`**

1. **Create a JSON configuration file** (`db_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
       "host": "your_postgres_host",
       "port": "5432",
       "dbname": "your_database_name",
       "user": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password"
   }
   ```

2. **Run your Python script**:
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       with PostgresConnector('db_config.json') as db:
           query = "SELECT * FROM your_table_name LIMIT 10;"  # Example SQL query
           data = db.query(query)  # Run the query and get a DataFrame
           if data is not None:
               print(data)  # Print the DataFrame for verification
   ```

---

### **üîç Key Features**
- **Error Logging:** All connection and query issues are logged into `db_connector.log` for debugging.
- **Timeout Option:** Prevents queries from hanging indefinitely by setting a 30-second timeout.
- **Resource Management:** The `with` statement ensures the database connection is automatically closed after the query execution.
- **pandas Integration:** Results are directly returned as a DataFrame for further analysis.

---

### **üöÄ Benefits of Using This Approach**
- **Secure and Flexible:** No hardcoded credentials‚Äîeverything is stored in a separate configuration file.
- **Clean Code:** Automatic resource management with `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
- **Scalable:** Easily reusable for multiple projects.
