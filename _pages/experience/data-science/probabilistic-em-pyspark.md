title: "Advanced Probabilistic Entity Deduplication in Large-Scale Organizational Database Using PySpark"
---
**Company Name:** H1 Insight Inc <br>
**Duration:** Oct 2023 - March 2024 

#### Introduction
- **Project Overview:** Directed a large-scale database deduplication project, leveraging advanced probabilistic models and entity matching techniques to enhance data integrity in an organizational database with over 1 million records.
- **Role:** Data Scientist - Entity Matching Engineer

#### Objectives
- Develop and implement a sophisticated probabilistic entity deduplication system tailored for a large-scale organizational database.
- Significantly reduce duplication errors and enhance the database's accuracy and reliability.
- Streamline the integration of new data entries to maintain continuous data integrity and quality.

#### Challenges
- Implementing advanced probabilistic models, such as the Fellegi-Sunter model combined with the Expectation Maximization algorithm, in a scalable deduplication process.
- Managing over 1 million records with continuous new data entries while maintaining data integrity.
- Researching and applying the latest techniques to address challenges in the deduplication process.

#### Approach and Implementation
- **Methodology:** Led the research and development of the deduplication system using PySpark, applying technical and academic knowledge to ensure a scalable approach to entity matching.
- **Technologies and Tools:** PySpark, Fellegi-Sunter model, Expectation Maximization algorithm.
- **Implementation Details:** Developed and optimized PySpark scripts for large-scale data processing, addressing complex data variations and inconsistencies with advanced techniques.

#### Results and Impact
- Successfully reduced duplication errors by approximately 40%, enhancing the database's accuracy and reliability.
- Achieved a 30% increase in operational efficiency related to data management through streamlined data integration.
- Reduced manual data review efforts by 50%, thanks to the automated and accurate identification of duplicate entries.
- Played a crucial role in enhancing the organizationâ€™s data-driven decision-making process, establishing a new benchmark in large-scale data deduplication.

#### Lessons Learned
- The application of advanced probabilistic models and entity matching techniques can significantly improve data integrity and operational efficiency in large-scale databases.
- Continuous research and adaptation of the latest deduplication techniques are essential for maintaining data quality and integrity.
