### Course Work: 

- **Classical Mechanics**: This course delves into the fundamental principles of classical mechanics, covering topics such as Newton's laws, conservation laws, systems of particles, rigid body dynamics, and oscillatory motion. It emphasizes mathematical modeling and problem-solving in physical scenarios, requiring students to apply theoretical concepts to practical situations.

- **Classical Optics**: An advanced study of the behavior of light, including wave optics, ray optics, and optical instruments. The course covers phenomena such as interference, diffraction, polarization, and the propagation of light through various media. Students will explore both the theoretical frameworks and experimental techniques used in classical optics.

- **Advanced Laboratory Practice**: This course is designed to enhance students' experimental skills and understanding of physical phenomena through advanced laboratory experiments. It covers a wide range of topics and techniques, requiring students to design experiments, collect and analyze data, and interpret results in the context of theoretical physics.

- **Atomic and Molecular Physics**: This course covers the structure, properties, and behavior of atoms and molecules. Topics include quantum mechanics applied to atomic and molecular systems, spectroscopy, and the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter. Students will explore both the theoretical underpinnings and experimental evidence of atomic and molecular physics.

- **Master's Thesis I and II**: These courses represent the culmination of the Master's program, where students are required to conduct original research under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The thesis project is expected to contribute new knowledge to the field of experimental physics, demonstrating the student's ability to perform independent research, analyze data, and communicate findings effectively.
